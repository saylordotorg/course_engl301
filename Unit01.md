     The earliest known works of literary criticism in the Western world
    were written by Plato and his student Aristotle in Greece in the
    fourth century BCE. At that time, the Greeks had a wealth of
    literature to discuss and compare thanks to their already
    centuries-old traditions of drama and epic poetry (most notably,
    *The Iliad* and *The Odyssey*, both attributed to the poet Homer).  
      
     Following your reading, consider answering the following questions:
    What do Plato and Aristotle argue are the main purposes of
    literature? How does Aristotle distinguish between the genres of
    poetry? What are the six elements of tragedy, according to
    Aristotle? What does Plato believe the social purpose of art to be?
    How do the aesthetic theories of Plato and Aristotle differ from
    each other?
