**Unit 8: Literary Theories in the New Century and Arguments against
Literary Theory** <span id="8"></span> 
*As the field of literary theory continues to advance, a plethora of new
critical perspectives has come to the fore in recent years. Today, a
number of cutting-edge theories that draw on the principle of the Other,
earlier modes of literary theory, and/or related intellectual
fields—such as philosophy, psychology, and mathematics—are continuing to
shape literary studies. However, the popularization of literary theory
throughout the academy over the past forty years also has led to a
counter-movement amongst a number of academics who have dismissed the
validity of literary theory. The final unit of this course will examine
some of the more recently developed literary theories as well as present
a few arguments that critique the validity of literary theory.*

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 11 hours.
