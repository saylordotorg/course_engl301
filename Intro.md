This course will introduce you to the field of literary theory, a
central component of contemporary studies in English and world
literature. As you progress through this course, you will gain knowledge
of the various premises and methods available to you as a critical
reader of literature. You will identify and engage with key questions
that have animated - and continue to animate - theoretical discussions
among literary scholars and critics, including issues pertaining to
ideology, cultural value, the patriarchal and colonial biases of Western
culture and literature, and more. The structure of this course is
historically based, arranged as a genealogy of theoretical paradigms,
beginning in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century - when literary theory
first developed as a formal discipline - and following the evolution of
literary theory into the present day. From text-centric Russian
formalism to contemporary gynocriticism and trauma theory, you will
explore the basic principles and preeminent texts that have defined many
of the major critical debates surrounding literature over the past
hundred years.
