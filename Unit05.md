**Unit 5: Marxism, Ideology, and Materialism** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, you will examine approaches to literature that are
largely sociological in nature, as many of the thinkers you are about to
encounter understand works of literature as products of historical
forces that are best analyzed through careful consideration of the
material conditions in which they were produced. This unit will focus on
literary theories that explore the historical, social, cultural, and
political conditions under which literature is formed and produced.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 21 hours.

    (PDF); Project Gutenberg’s
    [version](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-h/1342-h.htm) of
    Jane Austen’s *Pride and Prejudice* (HTML); and The Saylor
    Foundation’s *An Introduction to Literary Theory*
    Coursepack: [*“Applying Theory to Jane Austen’s* *Pride and
    Prejudice”*](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ENGL301-Applying-Theory-to-Jane-Austen.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Access the readings, beginning with the Saylor
    Foundation’s excerpts from Bakhtin’s essay “Discourse in the Novel,”
    for a sense of Bakhtin’s principle theories. “Discourse in the
    Novel” is perhaps the most distilled version of Bakhtin’s theories
    concerning language, ideology, and discourse. In it, he claims that
    every human utterance is part of a complex web of dialogic
    interrelations with other utterances.  
      
    Following your exploration of Bakhtin, read all of Chapter 1 of Jane
    Austen’s *Pride and Prejudice* *and the Saylor Foundation’s
    “Applying Theory to Jane Austen’s* *Pride and Prejudice” from
    Saylor’s* *An Introduction to Literary Theory Coursepack.* The
    coursepack may be downloaded at the top of this course, or the
    section titled “Applying Theory to Jane Austen's *Pride and
    Prejudice*” may be downloaded from the link above. Read the section
    and answer the study questions provided at the end of the section.
    Keep this reading in mind for the next assignment, in which you will
    listen to Dr. Fry’s lecture discussing *heteroglossia* in the text
    more specifically.  
        
     Reading these sections should take approximately 2 hours.
