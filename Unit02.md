**Unit 2: Form, Structure, and Signs** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit you will explore, in greater detail, some of the first
schools of literary thought that arose in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.
These interpretive approaches are text-oriented, sharing an emphasis on
literary form and textual device. According to many of the thinkers you
will encounter in this unit, neither the author’s intention for a work
of literary art, nor the context in which the work was written, matters
when deriving meaning from that work.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 13 hours.
