**Unit 3: Post-Structuralisms** <span id="3"></span> 
*As denoted by the plural nature of this unit’s title, poststructuralism
is a less-unified theoretical movement than its precursors. Perhaps this
lack of coherence is fitting, as many of the most famous
poststructuralist thinkers challenge the notion that critical discourse
can be coherent - just as they question whether language can truly
communicate. Shocking and self-defeating as these theories may sound,
they have greatly influenced much of 20<sup>th</sup>-century literary
and philosophical thinking. In this unit, you will explore these
poststructuralist theories, attempting both to situate them in terms of
the theories you already have examined and to identify their potential
limitations.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 21.25 hours.

    Children”](http://www.web-books.com/Classics/Poetry/Anthology/Yeats/Among.htm) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: First, read the excerpt from Jacques Derrida’s *Of
    Grammatology* for his discussion of deconstructionist concepts. In
    *Of Grammatology*, Derrida, often considered the father of
    deconstructionist thought, demonstrates that, when reduced to its
    most fundamental elements, a text becomes a set of irreducible
    signs, losing its narrative coherence. Following your reading of
    Derrida, read William Butler Yeats’s poem “Among School Children”
    before moving on to the resource below (Dr. Paul H. Fry’s second
    lecture on deconstruction, in which Dr. Fry performs a
    deconstructionist critique of Yeats’s poem).  
      
     Following your reading, consider answering the following question:
    What do deconstructionist critiques reveal about pieces of
    literature that other critical perspectives might not be able to
    show?  
      

    Completing these readings should take approximately 1.5 hours.

    of the video are available through Yale’s Open Yale Courses website,
    also linked above.  
      
     Following your viewing of the lecture, consider answering the
    following questions: What does Derrida suggest about culture and its
    relationship to nature? How does this relationship between culture
    and nature connect to Derrida’s understanding of language and
    meaning? In what ways do Paul de Man’s ideas about rhetoric versus
    grammar help us to understand tensions in language and meaning? What
    are some of the criticisms of or concerns about deconstruction that
    have been expressed by scholars? What are some of the ways in which
    proponents of deconstruction might defend this theory against these
    criticisms or concerns, particularly when considering the nature of
    reality?  
      
    Watching this lecture and considering the above study questions
    should take approximately 1.5 hours.

    Author?”](http://evans-experientialism.freewebspace.com/foucault3.htm) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read the online excerpts of Barthes’s “The Death of
    the Author” and Foucault’s “What Is an Author?”In his influential
    essay “The Death of the Author,” critic Roland Barthes challenges
    those readers who attempt to interpret a text by seeking to
    determine authorial intention or biographical context, claiming
    instead that the reader, not the author, writes the text. In “What
    Is an Author,” critic Michel Foucault also grapples with the concept
    of the author, tracing what he calls the “author-function” and its
    development throughout history.  
      
     Following your reading, consider answering the following questions:
    How does Foucault understand the concept of the author as compared
    with Barthes’s vision of the author? Do Foucault and Barthes agree
    or disagree on this point, and to what extent?  
      
    Completing these readings should take approximately 2 hours.
