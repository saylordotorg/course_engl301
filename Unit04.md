**Unit 4: Feminism, Gender, and Queer Theory** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, you will examine various forms of feminist and gender
theories, recognizing the ways in which categories of gender and sex
have shaped literary expression. You will explore the deep ambivalence
that many of these literary theories share when addressing basic
analytic categories such as the concepts of* *gender,* *woman, and*
*man, exploring, for example, the way in which contemporary gender
theory considers such concepts to be social constructions.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 20.75 hours.

    Instructions: Access the readings, starting with the 1999 preface to
    Butler’s book *Gender Trouble,* for a first-hand look at Butler’s
    conceptualization of gender performance. In *Gender Trouble*, Butler
    argues that categories of gender and sex seem natural only because
    they are continually constructed and reinforced by the repetition of
    stylized acts, or performances. Following your reading of Butler,
    read the two sections from Dr. Felluga’s overview of Butler and her
    work; these sections provide a more concise explanation of Butler’s
    theories.  
      
     Following your reading, consider answering the following questions:
    How is gender performed, according to Butler? Can one’s sex be
    performed in the same way? Considering Butler’s ideas, do you think
    that gender is something that is innate, or is it something that is
    developed and situational?  
      
     Reading these sections should take approximately 2 hours.
